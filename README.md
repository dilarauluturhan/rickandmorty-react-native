## Features
In this application, a Rick and Morty character search and multiselect feature is developed using React Native, TypeScript, Expo and Zustand. The application dynamically fetches the character list based on requests to the Rick and Morty API and allows users to search and select characters.

Users can filter the character list via the search bar. Characters retrieved from the API are dynamically updated. Users can select multiple characters. The selected characters are displayed as tags in the input field at the top. Using Zustand, the state of the application is managed centrally. The selected characters, search filter and other necessary states are kept here.
